# admin-dashboard
An HTML and CSS project that focuses on the use of flexbox and CSS grid to style the website.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to *flex* (get it? *flex*boxü§£) my newfound knowledge of CSS grid along with all the other things that I have learned about HTML and CSS along the way. From creating simple layouts with flexbox to being able use both flexbox and CSS grid in conjuction with each other, CSS has come a long way. With HTML and CSS ever changing, new tools like CSS grid are meant to make styling websites more intuitive and efficent. The culmination of my progress will be a design of an admin dashboard such as the one that GitHub uses on their homepage. The reason why this project was chosen by [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) was due to the simplistic yet effective design a dashboard has. Having too much information in a webpage is a serious concern, and one way to solve it is by using CSS grid. Grids were designed for an intuitive layout that keeps information clear and concise, and what better way to implement this than CSS grid? 

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to primarily practice using CSS grid, a new layout tool in your CSS toolbox. Grids are both customizable and simple to use, with more structure and predictability compared to flexbox. Just like flexbox however, grids were introduced with the goal fix the conundrum web developers encountered when designing and developing their websites. Before CSS grids and flexbox, website designers were forced to use CSS tricks and hacks such as float in order to lay out their webpages correctly. This inconvenience soon became a thing of the past with the introduction of flexbox for flexible layout and later CSS grid. Both of these tools have their own uses and can also be used in conjuction with each other, making them great for all types of website. Due to how important these tools and skills are, it was no wonder why this project was created in order to get some more practice in. As the age old adage states, "Practice makes perfect."

## Ending Statements
It has been a couple of months since I started to learn how to program and become job ready, yet it still feels like that I have a long way to go. Even so, I've enjoyed learning and practicing everything I learned so far as it has been both productive and fun. I hope that in a couple more months I will become job-ready and maybe even ready to start my own entrepreneurial journey. If you have taken the time to read this as I am writing it, I would like to personally thank you. I am at this moment in life where everything is possible yet I could only choose one thing to devote my life to, and this is ultimately what I chose. Enough about me and I am getting tired of writing so much (so much "I`s"), so thank **YOU** and here's a quote just for *you*:

`‚ÄúIn three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on.‚Äù`
